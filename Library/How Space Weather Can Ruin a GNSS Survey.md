## 🛰️ Overview

High-precision GNSS surveys depend on stable signal propagation through the ionosphere. During periods of solar activity and geomagnetic disturbance, this stability can degrade — sometimes severely.

The result may be inaccurate solutions, extended processing times, inconsistent baselines, or outright failures in services like OPUS or PPP.

Importantly, equipment quality does not eliminate this risk. The limiting factor is the atmosphere, not the receiver.

**Analogy:**  
Conducting a GNSS survey during a geomagnetic storm is like trying to measure distances with a tape measure while someone keeps pulling and twisting it — the tool works, but the medium is unstable.

## 🌍 Why Space Weather Affects Survey Accuracy

GNSS positioning relies on extremely precise timing of satellite signals. The ionosphere introduces delays that receivers and processing software attempt to model and correct.

During geomagnetic storms, the ionosphere becomes highly irregular, causing:

- Rapid delay fluctuations  
- Signal phase instability  
- Increased noise  
- Cycle slips

**Analogy:**  
It’s like surveying through turbulent water — the objects haven’t moved, but their apparent positions constantly shift.

## ⚡ RTK Surveys: Most Vulnerable

Real-Time Kinematic surveys require continuous carrier-phase tracking. Even brief disturbances can force reinitialization or degrade accuracy.

During solar storms, RTK surveys may experience:

- Frequent FIX → FLOAT transitions  
- Increased horizontal and vertical error  
- Loss of consistency between points  
- Reduced repeatability  

📖 Reference:  
International GNSS Service — Space Weather Working Group  
https://igs.org/wg/space-weather/

**Analogy:**  
RTK surveying is like balancing a pencil upright. It works perfectly in calm conditions but collapses quickly when disturbed.

---

## 📏 Static Surveys: More Robust but Not Immune

Static GNSS surveys average observations over time, making them more resilient than RTK. However, severe ionospheric disturbances still introduce errors.

Possible impacts:

- Increased baseline noise  
- Reduced solution confidence  
- Biases in final coordinates  
- Need for longer occupation times  

📖 Reference:  
UNAVCO — GNSS & Space Weather  
https://www.unavco.org/instrumentation/geodetic-gnss/gnss-and-space-weather

**Analogy:**  
Static surveying is like taking multiple measurements and averaging them. If the measuring stick itself keeps changing length, the average becomes less reliable.

## 🧮 PPP Convergence Delays

Precise Point Positioning (PPP) relies on precise satellite orbit and clock data combined with long observation periods to resolve ambiguities.

During disturbed ionospheric conditions:

- Convergence takes significantly longer  
- Accuracy may plateau at lower precision  
- Solutions may remain unstable  

📖 Reference:

📖 Reference:  
IGS Real-Time Service Documentation  
https://igs.org/rts/

**Analogy:**  
PPP convergence is like focusing a camera lens slowly until the image becomes sharp. Space weather is like someone nudging the lens repeatedly, preventing a crisp focus.

## 📡 OPUS Failures and Inconsistent Results

The Online Positioning User Service (OPUS) processes static GNSS data against Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS).

During geomagnetic disturbances, users may encounter:

- Rejected submissions  
- Poor-quality solutions  
- Large coordinate discrepancies  
- Excessive residuals  

📖 Reference:  
NOAA NGS — OPUS  
https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS/  

📖 Reference:  
NOAA CORS Network  
https://geodesy.noaa.gov/CORS/

**Analogy:**  
Submitting OPUS data during severe space weather is like sending blurred photos for measurement — the reference system cannot extract precise information.

---

## 🌞 Why Long Occupation Helps

Extending observation time improves the ability to average out short-term disturbances.

Benefits of longer occupations:

- Reduced impact of transient ionospheric fluctuations  
- Improved ambiguity resolution  
- Higher solution reliability  

However, during major storms, even long sessions may not fully compensate.

📖 Reference:  
UNAVCO Static Survey Guidance  
https://www.unavco.org

**Analogy:**  
It’s like averaging many noisy measurements to find the true value. The more samples you collect, the better the estimate — unless the noise remains extreme.

## ⚖️ Static vs RTK Risk Comparison

| Method | Sensitivity to Space Weather | Typical Impact |
|---------|------------------------------|----------------|
| RTK | Very high | Immediate degradation |
| Network RTK | High | Regional inconsistencies |
| Static | Moderate | Increased noise |
| PPP | Moderate–High | Slow convergence |
| Long Static | Lower | Best resilience |

**Analogy:**  
RTK is a sprint that demands perfect footing. Static surveying is a marathon — slower but more tolerant of rough terrain.

## 🚧 How to Reduce Risk

### ✔ Check Space Weather Forecasts

Monitoring geomagnetic activity allows scheduling surveys during quiet periods.

📖 Reference:  
NOAA SWPC Forecasts  
https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/communities/space-weather-enthusiasts

---

### ✔ Increase Observation Time

Longer sessions improve statistical stability.

---

### ✔ Use Multiple Sessions

Repeating observations on different days reduces the chance of storm-related bias.

---

### ✔ Maintain Redundant Control

Ground control points or independent checks help detect anomalies.

---

### ✔ Avoid Critical Work During Storms

If KP ≥ 6 or significant ionospheric disturbance is forecast, consider postponement.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways for Survey Professionals

- Space weather can degrade or invalidate high-precision GNSS surveys  
- RTK methods are most vulnerable  
- Static and PPP methods are more resilient but still affected  
- Long occupations improve reliability but are not a complete solution  
- Monitoring conditions is part of best practice  

**Bottom line:**  
Ignoring space weather can lead to costly rework or unreliable survey results.

**Analogy:**  
Planning a survey without checking space weather is like pouring concrete without checking the temperature forecast — conditions may undermine the entire job.
