Phase 0
Copyright footer, make sure that there is a copyright footer on all pages and with the year, and next to that copyright it show the last time the page itself was editied,  with full Year Date Month Time, rounded to the minute.  This should be explictly conveyed in Eastern Time US.   EST or EDT as appropriate when time change happens.

**Accessiblity and readability**
The contrast between the dark background and text needs to have contrast increased a lot for accessibility, bright white text darker backgrounds as appropriate. also, look at all other components to make sure they are good for accessibility and have appropriate best practices for visually impaired reader devices.

Phase 1

the main page needs some UI updates. from the screenshot you can see the KP index chart is very small.  That should be at least 3-4x larger, Also, it needs to show the time relevant to the user's browser/system time zone.  This should be the case throughout the site.  You can keep UTC time in notices to perserve authenticity but the user's local time should be also shown, in 24hr timeformat with their timezone abbreviated to 3-4 character.  i.e. Eastern Standard Time is EST, Central European Standard Time, is CEST.  etc.   if no time zone can be determined then use UTC. 


Phase 2

Add linking to the cards on the homepage to their respective pages, i.e. active alerts to alerts  GNSS Risk and KP Index to the GNSS page. add in more help popups with appropriate icons to each card and on each page explaining what the card is or what it does.   

Phase 3
The GNSS Risk on the home page needs to be further explained with a range always shown in the form of a bar left to right gnss risk assessesment with clickable ? at the end of the title of the bar which will explain the gnss risk assessment system.  how its derived and where the development of this scale came from.

Phase 4
Events tab needs have better explanation. currently the last thing listed is from Feb 6, 1645, and its 3 days later. Clear date headers.  Also, if the solar wind has returned to lower levels then this should be indicated.
Alerts page needs alerts organied into categories, needs to have a major makeover to make it more useful, including searching, isolated categories shown, pages instead of infinite scrolling. etc.  Use best practices to make this much more useful.

Phase 5
the GNSS tab itself needs to have it's UI reworked to make it more clear, and more organized.
